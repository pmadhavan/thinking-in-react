This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to practice the
[Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) section provided at react documentation.

## Available Scripts

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
